Risk Perception, Procrastination, and Workplace Constraints
This study examines how risk perception and hypervigilance influence task avoidance and decisional procrastination in the workplace. Analyzing data from 124 employees, findings reveal that heightened risk behavior—driven by uncertainty, resource limitations, or unclear roles—significantly increases procrastination. However, organizational constraints do not moderate this relationship, suggesting they impact procrastination independently. The study underscores the need for organizations to reduce perceived risks and improve role clarity to enhance employee decision-making and productivity.
